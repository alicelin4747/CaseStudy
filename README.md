# **Assignment 1 - FinTech Case Study**

## Overview and Origin

* *Name of company*

    Tala

* *When was the company incorporated?*

    2011

* *Who are the founders of the company?*

    Shivani Siroya

* *How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?*

    While working for the United Nations Population Fund, Shivani interviewed thousands of people from emerging markets to study the impact of microfinance on their lives and noticed the biggest obstacle to broadening financial access was lack of data. Banks couldn't be able to make lending decisions or design financial products that fit people's lives. 

* *How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?*

    Tala is funded by 25 investors including Revolution and Thomvest Ventures as the most recent investors. It's also worth it mentioning that PayPal is also one of the lead investors in some funding round. So far Tala has raised 204.4M.  

## Business Activities:

* *What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?*

    Tala's mission is to provide people who don't have access to quality credit the opportunity for financial stability. Tala's first product is an Android app that offers instant credit and personalized financial education in Kenya, the Philippines, and Mexico. The problem Tala trying to solve is that despite having some level of financial stability, people in the merging market are not able to get loans from traditional financial institutions. Tala's mission also promotes inclusion and accessibility for all. 

* *Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)*

   Tala's customers are people who don't have access to quality credit, savings, insurance, or payments products. This type of customer is estimated to be 3 billion globally. Tals' unfair advantage is their targeted locations. While many other companies offer the instant loans to individual and small businesses, most companies are serving customers in the US or Europe. Tala's target is the emerging markets. 


* *Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)*

    The technologies that Tala uses include Adobe, Google Global Site Tag, Google Font API, Jenkins, Zendesk Web Widget, and WordPress. Tala's underwriting models use machine learning to determine the creditworthiness of the applicant using their smartphone usage. This is very different from the traditional models used in financial institutions. 

## Landscape:

* *What domain of the financial industry is the company in?*

    Micro Loan

* *What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?*

    The micro loan section was valued ast 134 billion in 2019 and it's projected to be 343 billion in 2027. The CAGR (compound annual growth rate) is 12.6% for this time period. One of the contributors to this growth is ever expanding access to the internet and smartphone. Given the increasing internet access, especially in the developing countries, in the past decade, companies are seizing the opportunity by creating a lending and borrowing platform on mobile phones. The other innovation in the microloan space is using machine learning models for creditworthiness instead solely relying on credit history. In some countries in SouthEast Asia, for example, credit score and history is a foreign concept. Hence new and alternative metrics must be developed in order to tap in this section and location. 

* *What are the other major companies in this domain?*

    Other major companies in this domain include SoFi, Lendingtree, Lendingclub. Kiva is a non-profit organization which provides a platform for crowdfunding projects. 


## Results

* *What has been the business impact of this company so far?*

    Tala has distributed $1 billion in credit to more than 4 million customers who utilize Tala loans to start and expand their small business, pay bills, and build a more stable financial lives since 2014.

* *What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?*

    Some of the performance metrics include outreach measurement, social cost-benefit analysis, and social return on investment (SROI). As for the for profit type of MFI, the additional performance indicators include yield on gross loan portfolio, costs per borrower, operational self-sufficiency and profit margin. 
 
    The mainstream impact measurement mainly concentrates on the output such as the amount of loans provided and customers served (Tala's numbers were mentioned prior) in this domain. Tala also developed metrics to measure financial health as the outcome of their product and service. The parameters of the metrics include *Use*, *Protect*, *Grow* and *Happiness*, which indicates despite being a for profit company, social impact is part of Tala's mission. 
 
    Kenya, one of Tala's targeted locations, showed positive impact in the immediate and long term impact through Tala loan. Immediate impact has income smoothing and emotional relief. 70% of the entrepreneurs reported positive feedback on cash flow management and 35% increase of positive sentiments from the beginning of the loan cycle to the end. Long Term impact includes growth, credit access, and financial literacy. 15% of respondents describe business expansion as their primary reason for using Tala. 
 
* *How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?*
 
    Tala's position in the micro domain is quite unique because it operates with a mission other than profit. Tala brought the micro loan digital lending platform to Kenya, when such a domain didn't exist. In addition, Tala's targeted locations are very different from locations where most other micro loan companies operate and target. Countries like Kenya have a very different landscape of digital lending compared to the US for example. 
 
## Recommendations
 
* *If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)*
 
    As Tala continues to gain customers and increase customer's financial literacy, services like budgeting, invoice tracking, and business PnL analysis would be helpful. Tala can also offer an app that help individuals setup and track financial goals. 
 
* *Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?*
 
    These services and product are beneficial to the company because it creates an ecosystem which will incentivize customers to stay with Tala for all areas of their financial lives. 
 
* *What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?*
 
    Tala would include a tracker feature in their existing app allowing customers to track their business activities and personal expenses. If Tala customers are using Square for business transaction or mobile payment such as google pay, Tala can get the data straight from the transaction and perform analysis by using Python.
 
* *Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?*
 
    Using Square instead of building similar products will speed up the service and python is a powerful data analysis tool that is free or close to free and easy to use.
